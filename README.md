### If you don't know or can't understand which one do you need to install, what's your mobile's architecture is, follow the given steps -

 - If you have `Termux` installed then paste the following code -
   
     ```lua
     getprop ro.product.cpu.abi
     ```
- And if you don't want to use terminal or any such thing, then you can use apps like `CPU-Z` to view what architecture your phone is.


### Is there no other way?

You can download this [apk](https://github.com/architmishra-15/PixGlance/releases/download/apk/PixGlance.apk) which can install the app for any architecture.

> :warning: **Warning:** The size of the apk would be quite larger than the others (about 3x more).
